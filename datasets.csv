Moreover, all entities are normalized to the HPRD database. These normalized terms are
stored in each entity's 'type' attribute in the source XML. This means the dataset can
determine e.g. that ""Janus kinase 2"" and ""Jak2"" are referencing the same normalized

focused on the identification of medications, their dosages, modes (routes) of administration,

The third i2b2 challenge—that is, the medication challenge—extends information
extraction to relation extraction; it requires extraction of medications and
medication-related information followed by determination of which medication
belongs to which medication-related details.

The medication challenge was designed as an information extraction task.
The goal, for each discharge summary, was to extract the following information
on medications experienced by the patient:
1. Medications (m): including names, brand names, generics, and collective names of prescription substances,
over the counter medications, and other biological substances for which the patient is the experiencer.
2. Dosages (do): indicating the amount of a medication used in each administration.
3. Modes (mo): indicating the route for administering the medication.
4. Frequencies (f): indicating how often each dose of the medication should be taken.
5. Durations (du): indicating how long the medication is to be administered.
6. Reasons (r): stating the medical reason for which the medication is given.
7. Certainty (c): stating whether the event occurs. Certainty can be expressed by uncertainty words,
e.g., “suggested”, or via modals, e.g., “should” indicates suggestion.
8. Event (e): stating on whether the medication is started, stopped, or continued.
9. Temporal (t): stating whether the medication was administered in the past,
is being administered currently, or will be administered in the future, to the extent
that this information is expressed in the tense of the verbs and auxiliary verbs used to express events.
10. List/narrative (ln): indicating whether the medication information appears in a
list structure or in narrative running text in the discharge summary.

The medication challenge asked that systems extract the text corresponding to each of the fields
for each of the mentions of the medications that were experienced by the patients.

The values for the set of fields related to a medication mention, if presented within a
two-line window of the mention, were linked in order to create what we defined as an ‘entry’.
If the value of a field for a mention were not specified within a two-line window,
then the value ‘nm’ for ‘not mentioned’ was entered and the offsets were left unspecified.

Since the dataset annotations were crowd-sourced, it contains various violations that are handled
throughout the data loader via means of exception catching or conditional statements. e.g.
annotation: anticoagulation, while in text all words are to be separated by space which
means words at end of sentence will always contain `.` and hence won't be an exact match

legacy of i2b2 (Informatics for Biology and the Bedside), adding 2 new tracks and 2
new sets of data to the shared tasks organized since 2006. Track 2 of 2018
n2c2 shared tasks focused on the extraction of medications, with their signature
information, and adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical narratives.
This track built on our previous medication challenge, but added a special focus on ADEs.

ADEs are injuries resulting from a medical intervention related to a drugs and
can include allergic reactions, drug interactions, overdoses, and medication errors.
Collectively, ADEs are estimated to account for 30% of all hospital adverse
events; however, ADEs are preventable. Identifying potential drug interactions,
overdoses, allergies, and errors at the point of care and alerting the caregivers of
potential ADEs can improve health delivery, reduce the risk of ADEs, and improve health
outcomes.

A step in this direction requires processing narratives of clinical records
that often elaborate on the medications given to a patient, as well as the known
allergies, reactions, and adverse events of the patient. Extraction of this information
from narratives complements the structured medication information that can be
obtained from prescriptions, allowing a more thorough assessment of potential ADEs
before they happen.

The 2018 n2c2 shared task Track 2, hereon referred to as the ADE track,
tackled these natural language processing tasks in 3 different steps,
which we refer to as tasks:
1. Concept Extraction: identification of concepts related to medications,
their signature information, and ADEs
2. Relation Classification: linking the previously mentioned concepts to
their medication  by identifying relations on gold standard concepts
3. End-to-End: building end-to-end systems that process raw narrative text
to discover concepts and find relations of those concepts to their medications

Shared tasks provide a venue for head-to-head comparison of systems developed
for the same task and on the same data, allowing researchers to identify the state
of the art in a particular task, learn from it, and build on it.

reviews posted by patients on ""askapatient.com"", about the effectiveness and adverse
drug events associated with Zoloft, Lexapro, Cymbalta, and Effexor XR.

This dataset can be used for (multi-label) sentence classification of Adverse Drug
Reaction (ADR), Withdrawal Symptoms (WDs), Sign/Symptoms/Illness (SSIs), Drug
Indications (DIs), Drug Effectiveness (EF), Drug Infectiveness (INF) and Others, as well
as for recognition of 5 different types of named entity (in the categories ADRs, WDs,
SSIs and DIs)
